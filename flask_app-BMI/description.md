Creation of the basic bmi app using flask scheme.
Creation of the two folders with the scheme of the page under the bmi.calc.html, the older folder is containing visualisation of the app in css format.
In the app function there are all functions runing under the app including BMI,PAL and CPM.
It is basic app using the python posibilites.

I really enjoyed the graphic side of the css and html and would like to further develop that.


I have tried to build the html connections, but different solution were not working or including the java witch was also not working.
At night I will try again to rebuild the page to put another html file and functions working there.
