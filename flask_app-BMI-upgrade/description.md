Creation of the basic bmi app using flask scheme.
Creation of the two folders with the scheme of the page under the bmi.calc.html, the older folder is containing visualisation of the app in css format.
In the app function there are all functions running under the app including BMI,PAL and CPM.
It is basic application using the python.

I really enjoyed the graphic side of the css and html and would like to further develop that.


I have connected the html files to one index html.
Additionally I have created the nav bar.
I have made color switching background.
I try to make it pretty.


Hope it is enjoyable.
It is far away from perfect, but hopefully after the course I can develop it further.
